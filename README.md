## Features

- üìö Pre-processes all the relevant code base files and keep them in sync.
- üß© Decides what files to update for the given task.
- ü§ñ Does code updates for you.
- üìã Shows you what was updated. Full process log with each AI interaction also produced.
- üîß Optional interactive mode to see the process with retry, continue, abort options.

### Tasks expectations
* Referencing current code:
‚úÖ Referencing a specific file by project relative path.
‚úÖ Referencing a specific file by file name only, ignoring the subdirectories path.
? Referencing a specific file by file name only, ignoring the subdirectories path with filename duplication.
‚úÖ Referencing a specific function within a file without the filename.
‚úÖ Referencing a major business concept that is exclusively used in one file.
ü§î Referencing a major business concept that is exclusively used in multiple files.
ü§î General logical requests. Your milage would differ by model, codebase and task. Some work. (Should introduce task scoring)
* Actions executed:
‚úÖCreate a new file.
‚úÖUpdate an existing file.
‚úÖUpdate multiple existing files.
‚ùåCascade updating related files like tests.
‚ùåDelete existing files. (It might empty them out, but not delete them currently)
‚ùåStart using new libraries. (Needs arbitrary code execution to install the library)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/fjrdomingues/autopilot.git`
2. Do `cd autopilot` to install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Create the `.env` file and set up the environment variables:
   1. Copy the .env.template file to .env: `cp .env.template .env`
   2. Set up an OpenAI API key and file with the key: `OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>`. [Create openAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
   3. Set the path to your code `CODE_DIR=<path-to-your-code>`
   4. Update `IGNORE_LIST=node_modules,coverage,public,__tests__`
   5. Update `FILE_EXTENSIONS_TO_PROCESS=.js,.tsx,.ts,.jsx`
   
## Running
* `node ui -t "YOUR_TASK"` - is the easiest way to start.
  * Solutions will be auto applied on your code and a git diff shown if possible. 
  * Alternatively you may specify `--auto-apply=false`.
* `node ui -h` - will show you all the options.

## Test/Interactive mode
This project is still in alpha stage. It's recommended that you use `node ui -i` for an interactive mode here you can review the output of every step before proceeding.

## Components

- **ui.js**: Handles the user interface (UI) interaction and utilizes the GPT-based summaries to complete tasks.

## ü§ù Contributing

**We are running autopilot on a server connected to the https://github.com/fjrdomingues/autopilot repository. New issues created will trigger autopilot and create a new Pull Request with a proposal. Running with gpt-4**

We welcome contributions! Please submit pull requests to the repository, and ensure your changes align with the project's goals and guidelines. Together, we can make **Autopilot** an even more powerful and efficient tool for developers!
